# React-Tic-Tac-Toe
Last Updated: *3/2/25*

## Description
This was my first attempt at using React. It is something I've always wanted to use in my career and figured a Tic Tac Toe App would be a good place to start.
I realize this project isn't necessarily the cleanest and could definitely use some optimization. For example, I could probably break down the board rows and tiles into their own components. 

## Learning Outcomes
This experience has taught me some useful concepts in React. I learned the following:
1. `Components` - I learned how to create new components and use them in other components. They can be made in a variety of ways such as Class or Function components and may contain a variety of responses.
2. `useState` - I learned how to import and use the 'useState' hook in React which can keep track of variable states and directly modify them.
3. `useRef` - I learned how to import and use 'useRef' in React which can be injected into DOM elements to directly modify them without having to "select" an element using classic JavaScript.

Along with the specific elements I learned, I got a sense for how react flows. I really enjoyed using it for this project and plan on doing more in the future.
